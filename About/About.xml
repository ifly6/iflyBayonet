v0.5.4. This is a public alpha. I make no assurances that there are no major bugs. Please report any bugs at https://github.com/ifly6/iflyBayonet.		

Adds a belt-equippable bayonet which attaches to bayonet-compatible weapons automatically without needing to create a whole new gun. Those bayonets can then be used in melee combat (if also equipping a ranged weapon with bayonet lugs). Bayonets cannot be used alone; an invisible force holds them to the belt.

For the technically minded, the mod specifically changes the bayonet-compatible weapon's "poke" melee attacks. It leaves other weapon types, like bashing with a stock, in, replacing any time a bayonet-compatible weapon pokes with a bayonet stab.

This mod also patches the average melee damage calculation and battle log to report use of the bayonet. It also alerts if a pawn equips a bayonet belt without a compatible weapon. If you don't like pawns equipping the belt, change your Apparel rules in Assign.

Bayonets are created at the smithing table. Their statistics are taken from a combination of knives and spears. The cost is a bit more expensive than a knife (the model of the bayonet is that of a 1907 SMLE bayonet with quillion) and the damage is a bit less than a spear.

Please report errors in 1.5. Preliminary tests were done to ensure that bayonet patching still works.
